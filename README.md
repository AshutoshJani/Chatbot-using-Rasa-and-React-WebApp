# Chatbot-using-Rasa-and-React-WebApp
A plain chatbot with minimal training data using the Rasa Framework and a React WebApp as front-end

To use this web-app you will need to install the Rasa Module using pip
```python
pip install rasa
```

_I will suggest installing rasa in an environment as this installation process install Tensorflow as well as Spacy modules which might be a few versions old will interfere with your base environment_
